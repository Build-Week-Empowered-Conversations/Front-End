# Empowered Conversation
Empowered Conversation aims to re-envision the future of social support. With our text-based tool, the person you want to have a ‚Äúhard conversation‚Äù with will be texted before the conversation with a heads-up so they can emotionally prepare themselves. From sexual assault disclosure to coming out, transitioning, grief and loss, we set the stage for relationships that are radically more supportive and meaningful than you ever imagined they could be.

## How Our Application Solves the Problem

 - Prepares the recipient for an incoming weighty conversation
 - Helps the sender get emotionally and mentally prepared for the conversation
 - **Helps to set the tone to a more soft, welcoming vibe!
 ## Features
 -   This project requires use of the Twilio API to fully function.
    
-   A "Use our Tool" page.
-   On the "Use our Tool" page, a form that has four fields for the user to fill in:
-   Friend/family member's name
-   Friend/family phone number
-   Your name
-   Your phone number
-   A continue button
-   A pop-up consent/liability waiver before the form sends. (And then which sends the form when they check the box and press submit.)
-  Pop up to confirm the message was sent to the person the user entered
-   A text notification, through Apple APNs or other push API, the friend/family member will receive.
